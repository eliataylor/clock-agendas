  "desc": "<p>Imagine if every single individual in the country received $40 / week to spend only on locally grown groceries.</p> <p>I've calculated that below and it would cost ~$685 billion dollars. For some context the SNAP (ebt) program distributed ~$75 billion, providing ~40 million people with $150 / month for eligible food. (see footnotes below).</p><p>From reading the retail data, one problem I see is that so much of that money is spent on imported food. And only .05% at farmers markets.</p><p>If we could ensure the money spent stays circulating in the US, I would think we could get a lot closer to that $685 billion.</p><p>But this is not my area of expertise at all. I'm a developer and believe I can develop a food credits system for subsidizing locally grown food, especially in communities where their most common options are McDonalds and liquor stores.</p><p>So this is an invitation to share your insights, experience or ideas.</p>",
