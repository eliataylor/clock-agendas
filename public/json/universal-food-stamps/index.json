Only .05% is spent at farmers markets (see usda.gov links below).</p><p>I want to develop a food credits system for subsidizing locally grown food, especially in communities where their most common options are McDonalds and liquor stores. </p>\n\n<p>This is an invitation to share your insights, experience or ideas, and help bring this to life.</p>",
